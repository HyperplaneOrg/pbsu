## Introduction
This pbsu repository contains some basic portable batch system (PBS) utilities, which may 
come in handy for hacking processing workflows on systems that require one to use PBS. PBS 
is heavily used at HPC facilities to perform job scheduling by allocating resources for 
computational tasks among the available computing resources, etc... Users often submit 
and manipulate jobs via command line programs....

For more information about PBS see the [PBS works website](http://www.pbsworks.com)
and any manpages, such as qsub, qalter, etc...
